This major, offered in a program taught jointly between the CIS department and the Dept. of Finance and Business Management, is designed for students who want to use their computing skills in the field of business and organizational management. Combining a broad education in computing with the extensive "business intelligence" that today's organizations are seeking from their information technology staffs, the major will prepare students for such careers as Business Analyst, Systems Analyst, Database Administrator, Information Technology Specialist, and Information Consultant.

Important Note: To enroll in a CIS course, a student must have passed all prerequisite courses in the CIS department with a grade of C or higher. This is different from the policy of many other departments. This requirement does not apply to Math prerequisite courses, which must be passed with a D- or better.

## Possible Schedules for the IS Major

Students wishing to major in Information Systems are encouraged to see a department counselor as early as possible. *Note that the sample schedules in this section are appropriate for non-transfer students. Transfer students should consult with an advisor to plan their schedule at Brooklyn College.*

The following suggestions are offered to help a student arrange the required courses into a feasible schedule. Many other arrangements are possible, and each student should consider the prerequisites for the individual courses before planning his or her schedule. Students should also take Core courses as appropriate. Students may also take other advanced elective courses that are not required for the major.

It is important to move speedily through the CISC 1115, 3115, 3130 sequence, as completing that set of courses allows a student to take most other courses in the department.

In the schedules below, a CIS IS elective is CISC 3800 or 3120 or 3140 or 3171 or 3410 or 3820 or 3340 or 3345.
