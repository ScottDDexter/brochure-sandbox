This major, offered in a program taught jointly between the CIS department and the Dept. of Finance and Business Management, is designed for students who want to use their computing skills in the field of business and organizational management. Combining a broad education in computing with the extensive "business intelligence" that today's organizations are seeking from their information technology staffs, the major will prepare students for such careers as Business Analyst, Systems Analyst, Database Administrator, Information Technology Specialist, and Information Consultant.
