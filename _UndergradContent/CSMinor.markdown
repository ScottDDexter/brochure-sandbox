Students can officially minor in CS by taking 12 credits in CIS advanced electives, including at least one of 3130 or 3310. At least 6 of the credits presented for the minor must be completed at Brooklyn College. The 12 advanced elective credits must be completed with an average of C or better.

Three possible minors are the following:

- CISC 1115, 2210, 3115; 3130; and 3310
- CISC 1115, 1050; 2531 or 2210; 3800, 3115; and 3130 or 3630
- CISC 1115, 3115; 3130; and two additional courses numbered 2000 or above (however, make sure that you fulfill any prerequisites).

Any student who is not familiar with Microsoft Word, Excel, Access and/or PowerPoint is advised to also take CISC 1050 during his or her college studies.
