<h4>Undergraduate Programs</h4>
- a major in Computer Science, leading to the B.S. degree
- a major in Information Systems, leading to the B.S. degree
- a major in Multimedia Computing, leading to the B.S. degree
- a minor in Computer and Information Science
- a minor in Multimedia Computing

The undergraduate offering at Brooklyn College is quite extensive and includes some courses that are offered only at the graduate level in many other schools. There is a very strong emphasis on the discipline of programming, with substantial practical assignments in many of the courses. The programming language emphasized throughout the undergraduate program is Java, and a course in C++ is required. A number of other languages may be taken as electives

<h4>Declaring a Major</h4>
Choosing a major is typically done during the sophomore year. Students who wish to declare themselves as CIS majors should do so through the Brooklyn College WebCentral portal, <http://www.portal.brooklyn.edu>. Anyone wishing to consult an advisor should see Professor Moshe Augenstein (day; room 2122N, 951-5000x5041; <augenstein@sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu>) or Professor Joseph Thurm (evening; room 2109N, 951-5657;  <thurm@sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu>). Students interested in the Information Systems major should contact Professor Ira Rudowsky (room 1417N, 951-5000x2062; <rudowsky@sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu>. Their office hours are posted outside the department office, room 2109N.

Students interested in graduate (Master's and/or Ph.D.) programs should contact the Graduate Deputy Chairperson, Professor James Cox, room 2112cN, 951-5000x2047, <cox@sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu>.

## Additional Requirements for B.S. in CS, MMC or Computational Math

CIS candidates for a CIS B.S. degree in Computer Science, Multimedia Computing, or Computational Math must complete at least 60 credits in science and mathematics; 24 of these 60 credits must be advanced courses numbered 2000 and above taken in the CIS Department at Brooklyn College and completed with a grade of C or higher in each course. For the B.S. in Computational Math, these 24 credits must be in the CIS Department and/or the Math Department.

Transfer students should plan their schedules carefully to ensure that they take 24 advanced CIS electives at Brooklyn College.
</div>

Ordinarily, a Brooklyn College CS or MMC major will meet the 24-credit requirement through required CIS courses and will not require additional CIS courses. Additional CIS, math, and science courses, of course, are always helpful. Students should make sure that they meet the 60-credit science requirement.

The following courses may be credited as science courses for the B.S. degree: All courses in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer and Information Science, Geology, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology; B) Courses in the Dept. of Health and Nutrition Sciences marked with a (#) in the Bulletin; Anthropology and Archaeology 2200, 3199, 3230, 3240, 3250, 3260, 3265, 3266, 3425, 3440, 3470, 4665; Economics 3400, 3410, 4400, 4422; Philosophy 3203, 3204, 3231, 3232, 3422, 3423, 3601, 3605, 3610; Physical Education and Exercise Science 3023, 3271, 3275, 3281, 4229, 4251; and Sociology 2701.


## Department Recommendations

* CIS majors must complete the Brooklyn College General Education (Pathways) Curriculum.
* Incoming students who have programming experience should consult a department advisor.
* Each student should, with counseling, take additional elective courses that will satisfy the student's special interests. These may include courses in computer and information science as well as courses in mathematics, economics, accounting, physics, biology, psychology, health and nutrition sciences, or other departments. (See “Personalizing Your Major,” below.) By taking these courses, the student will also be prepared to apply computing to a particular field.
* Any student who is not familiar with Microsoft Word, Excel, Access and/or PowerPoint is advised to also take CISC 1050 during his or her college studies.

**Seniors with good grades may also take graduate courses, with permission.**

## Personalizing Your Major
