The undergraduate offering at Brooklyn College is quite extensive and includes some courses that are offered only at the graduate level in many other schools. There is a very strong emphasis on the discipline of programming, with substantial practical assignments in many of the courses. The programming language emphasized throughout the undergraduate program is Java, and a course in C++ is required. A number of other languages may be taken as electives
