This major is designed for students interested in the types of computing that are
used for entertainment, art and aesthetics. The major melds work in the Arts, Mathematics and Computer Science to produce students who are comfortable applying computing to non-traditional applications such as robotics, computer gaming, web production, and arts production. Building on our several-year-old minor in the field, the new major is designed to provide preparation for the increasing number of computing careers in the arts and entertainment industries.

The department chair, with the approval of the chair of the department's undergraduate curriculum committee, may allow substitutions for one or more of these requirements consistent with the educational goals of the program. For titles and prerequisites of these CIS courses, see **Section IV** of this brochure. For descriptions, see the Brooklyn College Bulletin.

Important Note: To enroll in a CIS course, a student must have passed all prerequisite courses in the CIS department with a grade of C or higher. This is different from the policy of many other departments. This requirement does not apply to Math prerequisite courses, which must be passed with a D- or better.

## Possible Schedules for the MMC Major

Students wishing to major in Multimedia Computing are encouraged to see a department counselor as early as possible. *Note that the sample schedules in this section are appropriate for non-transfer students. Transfer students should consult with an advisor to plan their schedule at Brooklyn College.*

The following suggestions are offered to help a student arrange the required courses into a feasible schedule. Many other arrangements are possible, and each student should consider the prerequisites for the individual courses before planning his or her schedule. Students should also take Core courses as appropriate. Students may also take other advanced elective courses that are not required for the major.

It is important to move speedily through the CISC 1115, 3115, 3130 sequence, as completing that set of courses allows a student to take most other courses in the department.

In the schedules below, a CIS MMC elective is an additional course chosen from among CISC CISC 3140, 3150, 3410, 3415, 3610, 3650, 3660, 3665, 3810, 4610
