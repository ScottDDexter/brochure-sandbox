This major is designed for students interested in the types of computing that are
used for entertainment, art and aesthetics. The major melds work in the Arts, Mathematics and Computer Science to produce students who are comfortable applying computing to non-traditional applications such as robotics, computer gaming, web production, and arts production. Building on our several-year-old minor in the field, the new major is designed to provide preparation for the increasing number of computing careers in the arts and entertainment industries.
