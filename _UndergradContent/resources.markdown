## The CIStalk List

There is a CIS email list, called CIStalk. The purpose of this list is to provide a way for CIS faculty to send to students and other faculty information on jobs, internships, and other articles of interest, Messages sent to the list are distributed via email to all subscribers to the list. The list is free, and all CIS students are encouraged to subscribe. Students may not post to the list due to abuses of the list in the past.

To subscribe to the list, unsubscribe from the list, or to access an archive of past postings to the list, go to <http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/cistalk/>.
