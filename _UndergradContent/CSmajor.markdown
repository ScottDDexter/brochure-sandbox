Important Note: To enroll in a CIS course, a student must have passed all prerequisite courses in the CIS department with a grade of C or higher. This is different from the policy of many other departments. This requirement does not apply to Math prerequisite courses, which must be passed with a D- or better.

Mathematics 1201 (3 credits) and 1206 (4 credits) are courses in calculus; Mathematics
2501 (3 credits) and 3501 (3 credits) are courses in probability and statistics. Transfer students who receive credit for Mathematics 3.20 and 4.20 are required to take Mathematics 1211 and either 2501 or 3501 to satisfy the mathematics requirement for the B.S. degree in Computer and Information Science. Students may be required to take Mathematics 1011 (precalculus) before taking Mathematics 1201.
