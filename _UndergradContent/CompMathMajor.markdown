The Computational Mathematics program, offered jointly by the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Computer and Information Science, prepares the student for a wide range of future careers and opportunities for graduate study. The Computational Option enables students to apply mathematical and computational skills to the physical, biological, social and behavioral sciences. It is designed for the education of applied mathematicians who plan to enter careers in scientific computing, or who wish to enroll in graduate programs in computationally oriented applied mathematics or in computer science.   The Theoretical Option is designed for those interested in the more abstract parts of computer science, and for those interested in college teaching and research.

<h4>Computational Mathematics Program Requirements (54&ndash;60 credits)</h4>
<h5>Option 1: Computational</h5>

One of the following mathematics sequences, a) or b):
<ol type="a">
<li>MATH 1201 and 1206</li>
<li>MATH 3.20 and 34.20 and 1211</li>
</ol>

MATH 2001, 2101, 2201, 2206, 4201, 3501, and 4701

CISC 1115 or 1170

CISC 3115, 3130, and 3220

Three of the following: CISC 3240/MATH 3107, CISC 3142, 3150, 3160, 3230, 3310, 3330, 3350, 3820, 4335.
</div>

**Recommendation**: Students choosing Option 1 are also encouraged to minor in Distributed and Parallel Computing.

<h4>Computational Mathematics Program Requirements (54&ndash;60 credits)</h4>
<h5>Option 2: Theoretical</h5>

One of the following mathematics sequences, a) or b):
<ol type="a">
<li>MATH 1201 and 1206</li>
<li>MATH 3.20 and 34.20 and 1211</li>
</ol>

MATH 2001, 2101, 2201, 3101, 4101, and 4201

CISC 1115 or 1170

CISC 3115, 3130, 3220, 3230, 4900

CISC 4900 or 5001

Three of the following:	CISC 3240/MATH 3107; CISC 3142, 3150, 3160, 3330, 3350, 3820, 4335.
</div>

**Important Note**:  Candidates for a degree in Computational Mathematics must also fulfill the requirements liste*d on page 8 of this brochure.

**Recommendations**: MATH 4501 is recommended. It is recommended that students should choose electives in departments that prepare them to apply computer science to a particular field of interest. Majors in Computational Mathematics may substitute MATH 2001 for CISC 2210 as a prerequisite for CIS courses.

<h4>Warning</h4>
Because many Mathematics and some CIS courses (e.g., CISC 3820), are offered no more than once a year or even two, students majoring in Computational Mathematics should plan their schedules accordingly.
